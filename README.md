I might as well be the physical representation of a variety stream, I'm driven by knowledge and self-improvement, and thanks to this most of my skills are self-taught, either for fun or I *really* wanted to try out something new.

### At a glance, as a developer

*Keep in mind that this does not reflect my actual skills nor the range of languages I know, only the ones that are present in my GitHub*

### Things I do as a job
This doesn't mean I don't have fun while doing these, but just to reflect that I've gotten paid for these

- **Coding** (Python automations (OCR, Neural Networks, RPA), Google Suite integrations with Apps Script, REST using Flask)
- **Dungeon Mastering** (Be it modules or homebrew sandbox, I enjoy DMing and I do it as a job, yeah seriously!)

### Things I do as a hobby
I'm by no means an expert at these, my skill level varies among these, they are driven by passion and enjoyment.

- **Video Editing** (Mostly to make gifs, but there was that one time where I made some [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/tronikart))
- **Audio Editing** (Looping stuff, cleaning voice recordings, audio editing for games)
- **Game Development** (Solo Unity Dev with sporadic collabs with artists, looking into working more and more on this)
- **3D Modeling** (Blender, making maps (TRPG), playing with particles, messing around)
- **Image Editing** (Really general Photoshop concepts, from actually editing a picture to making banners like that one up there â†‘)
- **Streaming** (A fun thing to do to share the things you're doing, in hopes you can entertain or educate someone)

### Things I like

- **ðŸ¤– Robots**
- **ðŸš€ Space**
- **ðŸ‘¾ General Geek Culture**
- **ðŸŽ® Gaming**
- **ðŸ“– Learning**
